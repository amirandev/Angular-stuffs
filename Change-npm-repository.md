If you want to change the npm repository from HTTPS to HTTP, you can modify the npm configuration to use HTTP instead. Here's how you can do it:

**Step 1: Open a command prompt or terminal**

**Step 2: Configure npm to use HTTP**

1. Run the following command to set the registry URL to use HTTP:
   ```
   npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

2. Additionally, you may also want to set the strict-ssl configuration to false to disable SSL certificate validation. This step is optional but may be required if you encounter SSL certificate errors:
   ```
   npm config set strict-ssl false
   ```

**Step 3: Verify the changes**

To verify that the changes have been applied, you can use the `npm config get` command:

1. Run the following command to check the registry URL:
   ```
   npm config get registry
   ```

   It should display the HTTP URL you configured, like `http://registry.npmjs.org/`.

2. Run the following command to check the strict-ssl configuration:
   ```
   npm config get strict-ssl
   ```

   It should display `false`, indicating that SSL certificate validation is disabled.

That's it! You have successfully changed the npm repository from HTTPS to HTTP.
