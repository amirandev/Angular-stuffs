**Step 1: Install Node.js**
Before installing npm, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. npm comes bundled with Node.js, so you'll get both by following these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org.
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

**Step 2: Verify Node.js and npm installation**
After installing Node.js, you can check if npm is installed correctly and verify its version. Here's how:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the following command to check if Node.js is installed and see its version:
   ```
   node -v
   ```
   You should see the version number printed in the output.
3. Run the following command to check if npm is installed and see its version:
   ```
   npm -v
   ```
   You should see the version number printed in the output.

**Step 3: Update npm (optional)**
If you already have npm installed, you may want to update it to the latest version. Here's how:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the following command to update npm globally:
   ```
   npm install -g npm
   ```
   This command will update npm to the latest version available.

**Step 4: Set up an Angular app**
Now that you have npm installed and updated (if necessary), you can proceed to set up an Angular app. Here's the process:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Change to the directory where you want to create your Angular app.
3. Run the following command to install the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) globally:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
   This command will install the Angular CLI, which provides a set of powerful commands for creating and managing Angular applications.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can create a new Angular app by running the following command:
   ```
   ng new my-app
   ```
   Replace "my-app" with the desired name for your app. This command will generate a new Angular project with the specified name.
5. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-app
   ```
6. Finally, start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   ng serve
   ```
   This command will compile the Angular app and launch a development server. You can access your app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:4200`.
